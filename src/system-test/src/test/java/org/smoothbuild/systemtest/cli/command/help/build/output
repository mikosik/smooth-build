Usage:
smooth build [-l=<level>] [-s=<filter>] [-t=<filter>] <value>...

Description:
Evaluate specified value(s) and store them as artifact(s).

Parameters:
      <value>...   value(s) to evaluate and store as artifact(s)

Options:
  -l, --filter-logs=<level>
                   Print logs with specified level or above.
                   Defaults value is 'info'.

                   Available levels:
                     f, fatal   - show FATAL logs
                     e, error   - show FATAL, ERROR logs
                     w, warning - show FATAL, ERROR, WARNING logs
                     i, info    - show FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO logs

  -s, --filter-stack-traces=<filter>
                   Print stack trace for task execution reports that match
                     filter.
                   Default value is 'error'.

                   Filter is specified using the same language as used for
                     specifying filters
                   in --filter-tasks option.

  -t, --filter-tasks=<filter>
                   Print executed tasks that match filter. Amount of
                     information provided for each task is specified by
                     --filter-stack-traces and --filter-logs.

                   Filter is a boolean expression made up of matchers (listed
                     below), boolean operators '&', '|', grouping brackets '(',
                     ')'.
                   Default value is 'info|:vm:evaluate:invoke'

                   For each matched tasks its label, trace and logs are printed
                     which can be further filtered using --filter-logs and
                     --filter-stack-traces options. Note that you can filter
                     tasks by one log level and its logs by other level. For
                     example setting '--filter-tasks=error
                     --filter-logs=warning' prints tasks that have a log with
                     at least error level and for each such a task all logs
                     with at least warning level.

                   Available task matchers:
                     a, all         - all tasks
                     d, default     - shortcut for 'info|invoke'
                     n, none        - no tasks

                     lf, fatal      - contains a log with fatal level
                     le, error      - contains a log with at least error level
                     lw, warning    - contains a log with at least warning level
                     li, info       - contains any log

                     <glob pattern> - has label that matches glob pattern. "**"
                     matches any number of characters. "*" matches any number
                     of characters that not contain ":". For example ":vm:**"
                     matches all tasks which label starts with ":vm:".
