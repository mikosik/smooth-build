### smooth-build

smooth-build is a build tool. It features:
 - strongly and statically typed purely functional language with lazy evaluation
 - fine-grained, aggressive caching that will make sure
no computation happens twice on the same machine
 - everything runs in parallel automatically (Yeah! That's the beauty of functional language.)
