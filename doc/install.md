Downloading and Installation
----------------------------

Download the latest
[smooth-v.v.v.zip](https://github.com/mikosik/smooth-build/releases)
file and unzip it. It contains one "smooth" directory.

Download Java Development Kit version 7 (or newer) and install it on your
system. 
It is needed as Smooth is implemented in Java.

Smooth can be run by `smooth/smooth` script unzipped from smooth.zip.

You may add unzipped "smooth" directory to your system PATH to make smooth
runnable from any directory.
