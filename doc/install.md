Downloading and Installation
----------------------------

Download the latest smooth-xxx.zip file from
[release page](https://github.com/mikosik/smooth-build/releases)
and unzip it. It contains one "smooth" directory.

Download Java Development Kit version 15 (or newer) and install it on your
system.
It is needed as Smooth is implemented in Java.

Smooth can be run by `smooth/smooth` script unzipped from smooth.zip.

You may add unzipped "smooth" directory to your system PATH to make smooth
runnable from any directory.
